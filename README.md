# Sponsored Detector

This project detects the word "sponsored" on screen via an AccessibilityService and automatically mutes system media audio when sponsored content is detected. It restores audio when the text disappears.

Install by building with Android Studio or via Gradle.

Note: You still need to register the Accessibility Service in system settings and grant overlay permission.
